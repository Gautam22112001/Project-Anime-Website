           2) https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=J06Uz7m-Jn8
      essentially  what passive does is that whwnever an event listener is trigerred the browswer has to execute it but before executing the event the browser has to completely run the callBack function(.addEventListener('event', callBack function)) because there is a posibility that the event could be cancelled (by using e.preventDefault() function). Therefore there might be a slight delay before the event is executed as the call Back function has to finish running so to prevent this we use (passive: true) , which means that we are promising our browser that we have not cancelled our event anywhere in callBack function and the browser can directly fire the event without first completely running the callBack function.
